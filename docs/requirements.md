# Functional Scope Document: Loan Prequalification Service

## 1. Project Objective

To design, build, and test a "Loan Prequalification Service" as a set of event-driven microservices. The project will demonstrate a practical understanding of building a RESTful API, database interaction, asynchronous processing with a message broker (Kafka), and implementing a conceptual CI/CD pipeline for code quality.

## 2. Business Context (Indian Financial Market)

In the fast-growing Indian credit market, lenders (Banks and NBFCs) need to provide instant, high-level decisions on loan eligibility to capture new customers. This "prequalification" step is not a final approval but a quick check to see if an applicant meets the basic criteria.

This service will simulate this process by:

1. Accepting a minimal loan application (with a **PAN Number**).
2. Asynchronously simulating a **CIBIL score** check.
3. Applying business rules to make a prequalification decision.

This decoupled, event-driven architecture ensures the user-facing API is fast and resilient, while the complex processing happens reliably in the background.

## 3. Functional Scope

| Feature | In Scope (What we will build) | Out of Scope (What we will not build) |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **API** | A RESTful API to submit an application and check its status. | A full UI/front-end for the application. |
| **Data** | Store application status and key details (PAN, income, amount) in a PostgreSQL DB. | Storing full personal identification data (Aadhaar, address, etc.) |
| **Credit Check** | A simulated CIBIL score service based on PAN and income. | Actual integration with a credit bureau (e.g., CIBIL, Experian). |
| **Processing** | Asynchronous, event-driven processing using Kafka. | Synchronous, blocking request processing. |
| **Security** | Basic data validation (Pydantic). | Authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) or user management. |
| **CI/CD** | A local, conceptual pipeline using pre-commit, pytest, and a Makefile to automate linting, formatting, and testing. | A full, deployed CI/CD pipeline (e.g., to AWS, GCP) or any cloud infrastructure setup. |

## 4. High-Level Design

The system will consist of three independent Python services, one database, and one message broker, all orchestrated locally using docker-compose.

### Architecture Flow:

1. **User** POSTs a JSON application to the **API Service**.

2. **API Service**:
   - a. Validates the data.
   - b. Saves the application to the PostgreSQL DB with status: `PENDING`.
   - c. Returns a `202 Accepted` response with the `application_id`.
   - d. Publishes a message to the `loan_applications_submitted` Kafka topic.

3. **Credit Service (Consumer)**:
   - a. Consumes the message from `loan_applications_submitted`.
   - b. Simulates a CIBIL score based on the `pan_number` and `monthly_income`.
   - c. Publishes a new message to the `credit_reports_generated` Kafka topic with the `application_id` and the `cibil_score`.

4. **Decision Service (Consumer)**:
   - a. Consumes the message from `credit_reports_generated`.
   - b. Applies business rules (e.g., score + income-to-loan ratio).
   - c. Updates the application in the PostgreSQL DB with the final status (`PRE_APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `MANUAL_REVIEW`).

5. **User** GETs the status from the **API Service**, which now reads the final status from the database.

## 5. Core Data Model (PostgreSQL)

### applications Table

| Column | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | UUID | Primary Key | Unique identifier for the application. |
| pan_number | VARCHAR(10) | Not Null | Applicant's PAN. |
| applicant_name | VARCHAR(255) | | |
| monthly_income_inr | DECIMAL(12, 2) | Not Null | Applicant's gross monthly income. |
| loan_amount_inr | DECIMAL(12, 2) | Not Null | Requested loan amount. |
| loan_type | VARCHAR(20) | | e.g., "PERSONAL", "HOME", "AUTO" |
| status | VARCHAR(20) | Not Null | PENDING, PRE_APPROVED, REJECTED, MANUAL_REVIEW |
| cibil_score | INTEGER | Nullable | The simulated CIBIL score (300-900). |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Default: NOW() | |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Default: NOW() | |

## 6. Service & Logic Definitions

### A. prequal-api (FastAPI)

#### Endpoint: POST /applications
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "pan_number": "...",
    "applicant_name": "...",
    "monthly_income_inr": 50000,
    "loan_amount_inr": 200000,
    "loan_type": "PERSONAL"
  }

Success Response (202):
jsonCopy{
  "application_id": "...",
  "status": "PENDING"
}


Endpoint: GET /applications/{application_id}/status

Success Response (200):
jsonCopy{
  "application_id": "...",
  "status": "PRE_APPROVED"
}


B. credit-service (Kafka Consumer)

Subscribes to: loan_applications_submitted
Publishes to: credit_reports_generated

Business Logic (CIBIL Simulation):

pan_number "ABCDE1234F" (Test PAN 1) → cibil_score: 790
pan_number "FGHIJ5678K" (Test PAN 2) → cibil_score: 610
Default Logic (for all others):

Start with base_score: 650
If monthly_income_inr > 75000: + 40 points
If monthly_income_inr < 30000: - 20 points
If loan_type == "PERSONAL": - 10 points (unsecured)
If loan_type == "HOME": + 10 points (secured)
Add a small random value (-5 to +5) to make it seem realistic.


Ensure the final score is capped between 300 and 900.

C. decision-service (Kafka Consumer)

Subscribes to: credit_reports_generated

Logic (Decision Engine):

Reads message:
jsonCopy{
  "application_id": "...",
  "cibil_score": 790,
  ... (all other app data)
}

Applies rules:

If cibil_score < 650: status = REJECTED (High Risk)
If cibil_score >= 650 AND monthly_income_inr > (loan_amount_inr / 48) (i.e., income is sufficient for a 4-year loan EMI): status = PRE_APPROVED
If cibil_score >= 650 AND monthly_income_inr <= (loan_amount_inr / 48): status = MANUAL_REVIEW (Good score, but income ratio is tight)


Action: Updates the applications table in PostgreSQL with the new status and the received cibil_score.

7. Local CI/CD Scope

Tools: Poetry, Docker Compose, pre-commit, pytest, Makefile.
pre-commit Hooks: Automatically run Ruff (lint) and Black (format) on every git commit.
pytest: Unit tests must be written for all business logic (CIBIL simulation, decision rules) and API endpoints.
Makefile: A Makefile will provide simple commands (make lint, make test, make run-local) to standardize the developer experience.
